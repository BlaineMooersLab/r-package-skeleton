Initializing Package
=============================================

Recommended steps for creating an R package, almost regardless of its content.  The list below is roughly a copy-and-paste list into new Issues in your GitHub repository.

Prereqs:
* Create a free personal [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
* *Optional*: Enable [two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).
* Create a public [GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).
* Create a [GitHub milestone](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests/) called "package skeleton".  Example: https://github.com/cibsr/stanirs/milestone/1

Copy & paste each item into a new issue.  Each should be assigned to the "package skeleton" milestone.
