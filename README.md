# r-package-skeleton

SCUG class for creating an R package

This is scheduled for two 1-hour SCUG meetings.

We'll be following  [`./documentation-for-developers/initializing-package.md`](documentation-for-developers/initializing-package.md).

After establishing Travis and/or AppVeyor, we'll cover branching, merging, & rebasing for ~15 minutes in another repository: https://github.com/wibeasley/class-branching.
